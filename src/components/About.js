        <h1>About The Art Outside</h1>
        <p>IÂ met Roland once before he passed away in 2020 but have since then spent hours with his lovely wife Jo Ann Weaver.</p>
        <p>She graciously showed me around her home and shared her albums of collected Outsider Art. 
          Their enthusiasm and dedication to finding and documenting these artists is infectious and I hope that you will too go out and seek, document and share what you find in the world around you.
          </p><p>
          I built this website because I could not let their work go unshared. I made it for Jo Ann because she recently lost her partner and when she talks about him you know she has lost her other half.
          I made it because I wanted to give Airtable and Gatsby a spin and this seemed an ideal project for it.
          </p><p>
          Their attention to detail was exceptional. Each album came with maps, notes, biographies, photos and a bibliography of the books and content they had used to scout out each of these artists. 
          I have only opened the one for North Carolina and entered the first 4 of 18 artists. We have just begun the process of transcribing their in-depth notes. 
          There are 7 more albums! 
          </p><p>I cannot do justice to the photo albums in full but I hope this website somehow captures a bit of the love they shared together. I also hope it inspires you to stop and check out the oddities you find along your path.
